# Mods for factorio
Features some mods for the game factorio.

# The Spice Rack
The Spice Rack is intended to spice up the vanilla game, without changing too much. Each change can be disabled individually.


## The Spice Rack - Lazy Assemblers
Crafting limitations for lower tier assemblers to make progression more meaningful

### Crafting Limitation
Select crafting limitation:\
"disabled" - off\
"assembler only" - Lower tiers of assemblers are not able to craft several midgame and advanced recipes\
"assembler and character" - Additionally, the character can't handcraft several midgame and advanced recipes (a subset of recipes from "assembler only"

### Lazy bastard marathon
The player receives some intermediate products (gears, circuits, pipes) on map start to have a chance to achieve lazy bastard with marathon settings.

## The Spice Rack - Oil Change
Change basic oil processing to output petroleum gas and additional heavy oil. Sulfur is obtained from heavy oil.\nChemical science is not necessary for robotic technologies (configurable)

### Oil change
"disabled" = off\
"basic oil only" = Basic oil processing produces extra heavy oil and sulfur is made from heavy oil. Solid fuel and cracking from heavy oil is available earlier. Solid fuel from petroleum consumes more\
"basic oil and research" = Like "basic oil only", plus no chemical science pack is required for lubricant, electric engine and robot technologies

### Steam cracking
Heavy and light oil cracking uses steam instead of water

### Solid fuel acceleration
Solid fuel acceleration is 140%


## The Spice Rack - Pollution
Change effectivity modules and furnaces/drills to increase difficulty due to pollution

### Effectivity modules
Change impact of efficiency modules:\
Effectivity module 1 has only 20% reduction\
Effectivity module 2 has 60% reduction\
Effectivity module 3 has 200% reduction

### Mining drill module slots
The electric mining drill has only 2 module slots

### Furnace power usage
All furnaces consume more fuel/energy:\
The stone furnace consumes more fuel and produces more pollution.\
The steel furnace consumes even more fuel, but pollution is like vanilla.\
The electric furnace is 1.5 times faster and produces more pollution accordingly. Power usage is higher, but it has 3 module slots.\
The burner mining drill produces even more pollution and consumes more fuel


## The Spice Rack - Science
Small, but impactful changes to science, labs and rocket silo to increase difficulty.

### Lab
The lab needs 3 times more power and a lamp to construct (20 lamps are added at the beginning, also for dark moments)

### Utility science
Utility science pack requires uranium-238

### Production Science & Furnace progression
Furnaces depend on lower tiers, so it affects production science pack:\
The stone furnace is built from stone bricks.\
The steel furnace needs just additional steel.\
The electric furnace needs concrete (overall a bit less steel, bricks and advanced circuits compared to vanilla)

### Rocket silo
The rocket silo research needs additional military science.\nThe rocket silo needs refined concrete instead of concrete and a programmable speaker


## The Spice Rack - Tweak Military
Several minor military balancing changes. (turrets, tanks, shotgun, research, damage, cost, ...)

### Long range gun turret
New long range gun turret (similar to the range of laser turret) with slower shooting speed\
It has lower DPS than a normal gun turret, but benefits more from damage upgrades

### Military 3 research
Military 3 research does not require chemical science pack. This also applies to the new long range turret

### Early military upgrade researches
Physical projectile damage 3 and Weapon shooting speed 3 has shorter research time (45 instead of 60).\
Weapon shooting speed is a bit less expensive for tier 1, 2 and 3 

### Shotgun
Improve shotgun (more near damage, projectiles spread wider, character moves a bit faster while shooting)

### Follower robot count
Follower robot count researches are less expensive

### Flamethrower turrets
The flamethrower turret consumes 3 times more oil and has less base damage. Still very powerful.\
Crude oil has only 50% damage, heavy oil 70% and light oil 100%.\
The flamethrower research is more expensive

### Laser turrets
The laser turret has more drain (60kW instead of 24kW)

### Landmines
Landmines are twice as expensive

### Spawners
Spawners are harder to kill (more health, more self healing, addtional laser and impact resistances)

### Tank
Improve tank (more hitpoints, weight and impact), but its more expensive

### Car
Improve car (more hitpoints, a bit physical resistance)

### Repair pack
Repair pack is more expensive
