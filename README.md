# Mods for factorio
Features some mods for the game factorio.

# The Spice Rack
The Spice Rack is intended to spice up the vanilla game, without changing too much. Each change can be disabled individually.

## The Spice Rack - Lazy Assemblers
Crafting limitations for lower tier assemblers to make progression more interesting

### Crafting Limitation
Select crafting limitation:\
"disabled" - off, vanilla limitations\
"assemblers only" - Lower tiers of assemblers cannot craft several midgame and advanced recipes\
"assemblers and player" - Additionally limit handcrafting of player for several midgame and advanced recipes

### Lazy bastard marathon
The player receives some intermediates(gears, circuits, pipes) on map start to have a chance to achieve lazy bastard with marathon settings.

## The Spice Rack - Oil Change
Change basic oil processing to output gas and heavy oil. Sulfur comes from heavy oil. Chemical science is not necessary for robotics technologies anymore

### Oil change
Basic oil processing produces extra heavy oil.\
Sulfur is made from heavy oil.\
No chemical science required for robotic technologies because lubricant can be produced.\
Steam is used for cracking.\

### Solid fuel acceleration
Solid fuel acceleration is 140%

## The Spice Rack - Pollution
Change effectivity modules and furnaces/drills to increase difficulty due to pollution

### Effectivity modules
Change cost and impact of efficiency modules.\
Effectivity module 1 has 25% power reduction and 15% pollution reduction.\
Effectivity module 2 has 55% power reduction and 40% pollution reduction.\
Effectivity module 3 has 200% power reduction and 120% pollution reduction.\
The mining drill has only 2 module slots.

### Furnace power usage
Furnaces consume overall more power.\
The steel furnace now is more efficient than the stone furnace both in terms of fuel and pollution.\
The electric furnace is faster and has 3 module slots, but requires a lot of power.\
The burner drill produces even more pollution and consumes more fuel.

### Furnace progression
Furnaces depend on lower tiers. The stone furnace is built from stone bricks.

## The Spice Rack - Science
Changes to science, labs and rocket silo

### Lab
The lab needs 3 times more power and a lamp to construct. Also, crafting time is longer.\
(10 lamps are added at beginning via a matching map setting.)

### Rocket silo
The rocket silo needs refined concrete instead of concrete and a programmable speaker. The rocket silo research needs additional military science.

### Utility science
Utility science pack requires Uranium-238.

### Lamps
Add 10 lamps to player inventory on map start. Not only for dark moments, but the lab requires a lamp, if the matching startup setting 'Lab' is checked.

## The Spice Rack - Tweak Military
Several minor military changes (turrets, research, damage and cost)

### Long range gun turret
New long range gun turret (similar to the range of the laser turret) with slower shooting speed.\
It has lower DPS than a normal gun turret, but is more expensive and gated behind chemical science.

### Military research changes
Military 3 does not require chemical science.\
Weapon shooting speed is a bit less expensive for tier 1, 2 and 3 research.\
Weapon shooting speed 3 and Physical projectile damage 3 has shorter research time (45 instead of 60).

### Combat robots follower count
Combat robots max follower count start with 10 instead of 5.

### Flamethrower turret
The flamethrower turret consumes 3 times more oil.\
Crude oil has only 60% damage, heavy oil 80% and light oil 100%.\
The flamethrower research is more expensive.

### Laser turret drain
The Laser turret has 4 times more drain (96kW).

### Grenade damage
Start with slightly more grenade damage (40 instead of 35).

### Landmine cost
Landmines are more than twice as expensive.
