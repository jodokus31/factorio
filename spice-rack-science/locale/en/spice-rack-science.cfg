[mod-setting-description]
spice-rack-lab-change=The lab needs 3 times more power and a lamp to construct (20 lamps are added at the beginning, also for dark moments)

spice-rack-utility-science-pack=Utility science pack requires uranium-238
spice-rack-furnace-progression=Furnaces depend on lower tiers, so it affects production science pack\n\nThe stone furnace is built from stone bricks, which affects early game\nThe steel furnace needs just additional steel.\nThe electric furnace needs addtional concrete instead of bricks (less steel compared to vanilla)

spice-rack-rocket-silo=The rocket silo research needs additional military science.\nThe rocket silo needs refined concrete instead of concrete and a programmable speaker
