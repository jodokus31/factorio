[mod-setting-description]
spice-rack-lab-change=The lab needs 3 times more power and a lamp to construct (20 lamps are added at the beginning, also for dark moments)

spice-rack-utility-science-pack=Utility science pack requires uranium-238
spice-rack-furnace-progression=Furnaces depend on lower tiers, so it affects production science pack:\n\nThe stone furnace is built from stone bricks.\nThe steel furnace needs just additional steel.\nThe electric furnace needs concrete, but less steel compared to vanilla

spice-rack-rocket-silo=The rocket silo research needs additional military science.\nThe rocket silo needs refined concrete instead of concrete and a programmable speaker
