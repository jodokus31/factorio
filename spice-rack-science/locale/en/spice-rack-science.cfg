[mod-setting-description]

spice-rack-lab-change=The lab needs 3 times more power and a lamp to construct (20 lamps are added at the beginning, also for dark moments)

spice-rack-utility-science-pack=Utility science pack requires uranium-238.
spice-rack-furnace-progression=Furnaces depend on lower tiers.\nThe stone furnace is built from stone bricks\nThe electric furnace needs concrete, but overall a bit less steel, bricks and advanced circuits than vanilla.\nThis change affects production science pack

spice-rack-rocket-silo=The rocket silo needs refined concrete instead of concrete and a programmable speaker.\nThe rocket silo research needs additional military science.
