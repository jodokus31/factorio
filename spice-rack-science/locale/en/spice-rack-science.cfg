[mod-setting-description]

spice-rack-lab-change=The lab needs 3 times more power and a lamp to construct (10 lamps are added at beginning, also for dark moments)

spice-rack-utility-science-pack=Utility science pack requires Uranium-238.
spice-rack-furnace-progression=This change affects production science pack and more.\nFurnaces depend on lower tiers.\nThe stone furnace is built from stone bricks\nThe electric furnace needs concrete, but overall a bit less steel, bricks and advanced circuits than vanilla.

spice-rack-rocket-silo=The rocket silo needs refined concrete instead of concrete and a programmable speaker.\nThe rocket silo research needs additional military science.
