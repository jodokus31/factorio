[mod-setting-description]
spice-rack-longrange-turret=New long range gun turret (similar to the range of laser turret) with slower shooting speed.\nIt has lower DPS than a normal gun turret, but benefits more from damage upgrades
spice-rack-flamethrower-change=The flamethrower turret consumes 3 times more oil and has lot less base damage. The refined flammable research adds more % damage as compensation to let it get stronger in end game.\nCrude oil has only 50% damage, heavy oil 70% and light oil 100%.\nThe flamethrower research is more expensive.\nThe flamethrower ammo also has less base damage and needs light oil instead of crude oil.
spice-rack-laser-turret-change=Laser turrets have more drain (60kW instead of 24kW)
spice-rack-gun-turret-damage-change=Gun turrets (and the new long range turret) profit less from physical damage research to reduce their insane DPS in late game
spice-rack-landmine-change=Landmines have reduced base damage from 250 to 75 and smaller aoe damage radius (5 instead of 6).\nThe stronger explosives research add more % damange as compensation to let it get stronger in end game\nArming timeout has increased from 2 to 5 sec. to reduce offensive effectiveness.\nThe stun time is reduced from 3 to 1.5 sec. but after that, the affected enemy is a lot slower for additional 2.5 sec.\nThe trigger area is reduced and the hitboxes are a bit smaller to allow placing them denser.
spice-rack-shotgun-change=Improve shotgun (more near damage, projectiles spread wider, character moves a bit faster while shooting). It has a bit of aoe damage directly in front and a small pushback
spice-rack-tank-change=Improve tank (more hitpoints, weight and impact), but its more expensive
spice-rack-car-change=Improve car (more hitpoints and resistances)
spice-rack-repair-pack-change=Repair pack is more expensive

spice-rack-change-military3-research=Military 3 research does not require chemical science pack. Same for new long range turret research
spice-rack-change-military-research=Physical projectile damage 3 and Weapon shooting speed 3 has shorter research time (45 instead of 60).\nWeapon shooting speed is a bit less expensive for tier 1, 2 and 3
spice-rack-change-follower-robot-count=Follower robot count researches are less expensive

spice-rack-spawner-change=Spawners are harder to kill (more health, more self healing, addtional laser and impact resistances)
spice-rack-biter-change=Big and behemoth biters have additional laser resistance.

spice-rack-rock-change=Huge rocks yield between 35 and 40 of coal/stone
