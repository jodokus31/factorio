[mod-setting-description]
spice-rack-effectivity-modules-rebalance=Change impact of efficiency modules:\nEffectivity module 1 has only 20% reduction.\n\nEffectivity module 2 has 60% reduction.\n\nEffectivity module 3 has 200% reduction
spice-rack-mining-drill-module-slots=The electric mining drill has only 2 module slots
spice-rack-furnace-drill-change=All furnaces consume more fuel/energy:\n\nThe stone furnace consumes more fuel and produces more pollution.\nThe steel furnace consumes even more fuel, but pollution is like vanilla.\nThe electric furnace is 1.5 times faster and produces more pollution accordingly. Power requirement is a lot higher, but it has 3 module slots.\n\nThe burner mining drill produces even more pollution and consumes more fuel
