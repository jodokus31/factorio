spice-rack-effectivity-modules-rebalance=Change cost and impact of efficiency modules. \nEffectivity module 1 has 25% power reduction and 15% pollution reduction.\nEffectivity module 2 has 55% power reduction and 40% pollution reduction\nEffectivity module 3 has 200% power reduction and 120% pollution reduction\nThe mining drill has only 2 module slots.
spice-rack-furnace-drill-change=Furnaces consume overall more power\nThe steel furnace now is more efficient than the stone furnace both in terms of fuel and pollution\nThe electric furnace is faster and has 3 module slots, but requires lots of power. \nThe burner drill produces even more pollution and consumes more fuel.
spice-rack-furnace-progression=Furnaces depend on lower tiers. The stone furnace is built from stone bricks.
