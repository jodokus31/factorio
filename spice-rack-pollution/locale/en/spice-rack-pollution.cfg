[mod-setting-description]
spice-rack-effectivity-modules-rebalance=Change impact of efficiency modules:\nEffectivity module 1 has 30% power reduction, but only 20% pollution reduction.\n\nEffectivity module 2 has 80% power reduction and 60% pollution reduction\n\nEffectivity module 3 has 200% power reduction and 120% pollution reduction.
spice-rack-mining-drill-module-slots=The mining drill has only 2 module slots.
spice-rack-furnace-drill-change=Furnaces consume overall more power.\nThe steel furnace now is more efficient than the stone furnace both in terms of fuel and pollution.\nThe electric furnace is faster and has 3 module slots, but requires lots of power.\nThe burner drill produces even more pollution and consumes more fuel.
