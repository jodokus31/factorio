spice-rack-oil-change="disabled" = off, like vanilla \n\n"basic oil only" = Basic oil processing produces extra heavy oil and sulfur is made from heavy oil.\nSolid fuel from petroleum consumes more.\nSolid fuel and cracking from heavy-oil is available earlier.\n\n"basic oil and research" = Additionally, no chemical science is required for lubricant, electric engine and robot technologies.
spice-rack-oil-change-steam-cracking=Heavy and light oil cracking uses steam instead of water
spice-rack-oil-change-solid-fuel=Solid fuel vehicle acceleration is 140%
