spice-rack-oil-change="disabled" = off\n\n"basic oil only" = Basic oil processing produces extra heavy oil and sulfur is made from heavy oil.\nSolid fuel and cracking from heavy oil is available earlier.\nSolid fuel from petroleum consumes more\n\n"basic oil and research" = Like "basic oil only", plus no chemical science pack is required for lubricant, electric engine and robot technologies
spice-rack-oil-change-steam-cracking=Heavy and light oil cracking uses steam instead of water
spice-rack-oil-change-solid-fuel=Solid fuel vehicle acceleration is 140%
