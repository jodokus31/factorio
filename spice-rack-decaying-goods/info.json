  "description": "The Spice Rack is intended to spice up the vanilla game by changing some well chosen details. Most changes can be disabled individually.\n\nBuffering gets even worse. Basic goods are decaying and emitting pollution, if they are buffered in chests. The more a chest is filled, the bigger percentage of the content is decaying...\n\nCAUTION: Not tested in multiplayer! Interested in feedback",
