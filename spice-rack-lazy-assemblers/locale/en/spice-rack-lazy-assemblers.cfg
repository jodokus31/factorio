[mod-setting-description]
spice-rack-crafting-limitation-mode=Select crafting limitation: \n\n"disabled" - off\n\n"assembler only" - Limit crafting of low-tier assemblers for several midgame and advanced recipes\n\n"assembler and character" - Additionally, limit handcrafting for a subset of those midgame and advanced recipes from "assembler only"
spice-rack-old-lazy-bastard=Lazy Bastard gets more challenging, because assembler 2 needs at least assembler 2 and oil refinery needs assembler 3 to be crafted.\nThe first ones have to be crafted by hand in order to proceed, similar to how Factorio 0.16 behaved.\n\n(Does nothing if "Crafting Limitation" is disabled)
spice-rack-lazy-bastard-marathon=The first player receives some intermediate products (gears, copper wires) on map start to have a chance to achieve lazy bastard with marathon settings.
